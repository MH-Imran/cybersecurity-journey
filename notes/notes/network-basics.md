# Networking Basics (Starter Notes)

I’m still pretty early in my networking journey, so these notes are mainly the things I keep reminding myself, while learning. I’ll keep updating this as I understand topics better, but here’s what I’ve got so far:

## OSI Model 
Basically the 7-layer “map” of how data moves. I don’t have every layer memorized perfectly yet, but the idea makes sense.

## TCP vs UDP  
TCP is the “reliable, slow-but-safe” one. UDP is more like “just send it and hope it gets there,” used for faster stuff.

## Ports I keep seeing everywhere 
- 80 [HTTP] 
- 443 [HTTPS] 
-22 [SSH] 
- 21 [FTP] 
- 25 [SMTP] 
- 53 [DNS] 
- 3389 [RDP]

These come up constantly so I’m trying to lock them into memory.

## Firewalls 
Easiest way I understand it: they decide what’s allowed in/out. Like a security guard following a book of rule.

## IDS/IPS 
- IDS notices suspicious behavior and basically “alerts.”
- IPS does the same but also tries to block the bad activity.

  Similar idea but different reaction.

## ackets 
Just chunks of data moving across a network. They have headers (like addresses) and the actual content.

## Subnets  
Groups of IP addresses that help keep networks well organized. Still wrapping my head around subnetting but the basic idea makes sense.
